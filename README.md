## Abstract

The [**EDC Connector**](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector) is a framework for a sovereign, inter-organizational
data exchange. It provides _low-level_ primitives to allow network participants to expose and consume offers.
The _Connector_ does so by providing an extensive HTTP API documented via
[OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/blob/a6fdb2a0b4360629ec562e11ae19d077162200b7/resources/openapi/openapi.yaml).

This project aims to increase the level of abstraction, bringing the _low-level_ HTTP API to _mid-level_
developers by providing an HTTP Client which is thoroughly tested and fully type-safe.

> Similarly to the **EDC Connector**, this library is at its early stage.
> It aims to maintain compatibility with the latest version of the _Connector_, currently `0.2.0`.
> The compatibility is reflected in the library's versioning.

## Usage

You can refer to the code under `examples/` directory for code snippets on how to use the SDK for various operations.

## Development

The development of this library is following a TDD approach. At the moment it
doesn't cover all EDC Connector capabilities, but aims to do so.

`docker-compose` is used to run the development environment. It runs two
connectors with capabilities described in the
[gradle configuration](connector/build.gradle.kts) file.
